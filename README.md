# This project is about the useRducer() hook and state dependencies.

# Project objectives:

- Handling states that depend on other states, where useState() is difficult to use.
- Utilizing the useReducer() hook where states rely on other states values to update their value.

# Studied and implemented from React-and-React-Native-4th-Edition.
